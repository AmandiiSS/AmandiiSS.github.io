    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    
    <p>
      The aim of this website is to show you my personal achievements and
      projects and some personal information that I want to share with you.
    </p>
    <p>Here I leave you some basic information about me:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I am actually studing Math and Industrial Engineering in the UPC.
      </li>
      <li>
        I like programming and I'm trying now to improve my skills in this area to be able to maybe work on it in the future.
      </li>
      <li>I've also discovered that I'm into<!--Mirar a veure si estÃ  ben expressat--> the 3D modeling world and I'm going to also improve my skills in it.</li>
      <li>I like many sports and my favourite one is handball. I play in a very cool team.</li> 
      <li>I enjoy spending some time watching TV shows, Anime and playing some videogames.</li>
      <!--<li>I write sometimes. You can check my Wattpad profile here.</li>-->
      
    </ul>

    <h2>Personal projects and other things I've done</h2>
    <p>
      In this part I will show you what I've been doing until now in the world
      of programming, 3D modeling and other.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>This entirely website.</li>
      You are now browsing through my personal website, wich I entirely made by
      myself learning by myself html and css.

      <li><a target="_blank" href="https://amandiiss.github.io/AjudaMaterials/">Material's website.</a></li>
      This link brings us to a website I've created starting from a free online website template that I liked it. I remodeled it to turn that website into a one that could help people studing the "Materials" subject in the ETSEIB by programming there diferent activities and "games" with the content of the subject as topic.

      <li>
        <a target="_blank" href="vidio.html"
          >Video of a futuristic roller coaster.</a>
      </li>
      This is a vidio that I did with the modeling program "Cinema 4D" following
      this
      <a
        target="_blank"
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BARSN-AJDF8&list=PLNhqGZVtzwiWEJ0bS_2pCrChKOVuTqdGy&index=86"
        >tutorial from youtube
      </a>
      that helped me to learn more about that program.

      <li><a target="_blank" href="llistafiguressolidworks.html"> List of figures in SolidWorks. </a></li>
      Here we have a list of all the figures I've done with the modeling program "SolidWorks" that I did while studing a subject (from industrial engineering degree) about 3D modeling in the university. We had the maps of the figures and we had to make them following that maps.

      <li><a target="_blank"> Ceiling modeling</a></li>
      I also modeled a ceiling for a project in which I had to choose an object made of different pieces (i chose a ceiling), take the mesures and make a map of each piece of it and then model each piece with SolidWorks and assemble all pieces to finally get the ceiling modeled.
