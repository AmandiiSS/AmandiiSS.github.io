      <li>
        I am actually studing
        <a target="_blank" href="https://cfis.upc.edu/ca"
          >Math and Industrial Engineering in UPC.
        </a>
      </li>
      <li>My favourite sport is handball.</li>
      <li>
        I like programming and I'm trying now to improve my skills in this area
        to be able to maybe work on it in the future.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Personal projects and other things I've done</h2>
    <p>
      In this part I will show you what I've been doing until now in the world
      of programming, 3D modeling and other.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>This entirely website.</li>
      You are now browsing through my personal website, wich I entirely made by
      myself learning by myself html and css.

      <li>Material's website.</li>
      This link brings us to a website I've created starting from a free online
      website template that I liked it. I remodeled it to turn that website into
      a one that could help people studing the "Materials" subject in the ETSEIB
      by programming there diferent activities and "games" with the content of
      the subject as topic.

      <li>
        <a target="_blank" href="vidio.html"
          >Video of a futuristic roller coaster.</a
        >
      </li>
      This is a vidio that I did with the modeling program "Cinema 4D" following
      this
      <a

        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BARSN-AJDF8&list=PLNhqGZVtzwiWEJ0bS_2pCrChKOVuTqdGy&index=86"
        >tutorial from youtube
      </a>
      that helped me to learn more about that program.

      <li>List of figures in SolidWorks.</li>
      Here we have a list of all the figures I've done with the modeling program
      "SolidWorks" that I did while studing a subject (from industrial
      engineering degree) about 3D modeling in the university. We had the maps
      of the figures and we had to make them following that maps.

      </li>
      This is the final document I made when I was 16-17 y.o. for the
      Baccalaureate's final research project. It is written in catalan.
